        This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.
    </p>

        Jack really like...
        <ul>
            <li>Roller blades</li>
            <li>Magic tricks</li>
            <li>Anything Pokémon</li>
            <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular one are <a href="https://toysrus.com">toysrus.com</a> and <a href="">eToys</a>.
