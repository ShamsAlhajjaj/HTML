    <h2><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></h2>
    <p>
        Mathematics is the <mark>science and study of quality, structure, space, and change.</mark>  Mathematicians seek out patterns. formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician <b>Benjamin Peirce</b> called mathematics <q>the science that draws necessary conclusions,</q> <mark>Albert Einstein</mark>, on the other hand, stated that <q>as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality. they are not certain: and as far as they are certain. they do not refer to reality.</q>

        <u>Today. mathematics is used throughout the world as ap essential tool in many fields, includipg natural science. engineering. medicine. and the social sciences,</u> Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application
        of <b>mathematical knowledge</b> to other fields. inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics
        for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.

    <h2><u>Introduction to Chemistry</u></h2>
    <p>
        <mark>Chemistry</mark>  is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter combine with each other. <u>You study chemistry because it helps you to understand the world around you</u>, Everything you touch or taste or smell is a
        <b>chemical</b>, and the interactions of these chemicals with each other define our universe. <i><u><mark>Chemistry formes the fundamental basis for biology and medicine</mark></u></i>, From the structure of proteins and nucleic acids, to the design, synthesis and
        manufacture of drugs, chemistry allows you
    </p>
    <p>
        <del>The prenciple of chemicals are quite varied and are essentially important which includes brain functioning, computer operations, weather patterns, chemical industries, manufacturing fertilizers, acids, alkalis, salts, drugs, soaps, etc.</del><br> Chemistry also acts as a major determinant in meeting the human needs for food. healthcare products, and also other <mark>materials</mark>  are aimed at improving the Life's quality.
